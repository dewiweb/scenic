Scenic: Telepresence software for live performances and installations

Scenic is a free software suite for streaming audio, video and MIDI between live events. It was created at the Society for Arts and Technology (SAT) to give to artists a powerful tool for telepresence in contexts of live arts and new media installations. 

The streaming is done over RTP with the GStreamer multimedia framework. Users can also choose low-bandwidth or high-quality codecs, depending on what is available on their system. It offers up to as many audio channels that your audio device supports. Scenic consists in a desktop application and several command-line utilities:

  * scenic: Desktop application to stream audio, video and MIDI over RTP 
  * milhouse: Streams audio and video over RTP
  * midistream: Streams MIDI notes and controls over RTP
  * dc-ctl: Controls connected DC IEEE 1394 cameras
  * firereset: Resets a IEEE 1394 bus to help in case of problems
  * jack-info: Prints informations about running JACK servers

See the NEWS and ChangeLog files for a complete history of changes.

    Upgrading:
    *   Be sure to uninstall your previous scenic before installing
        scenic.
    *   In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to
        uninstall previous installations.
    *   Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.
    *   As of 0.4.2 and later, you may want to run ./utils/install_gstreamer.sh
        again or simply apply the utils/rtpsource.diff patch to
        gst-plugins-good-0.10.17, then recompile and reinstall it. Refer to
        https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611213
        This fix adds receiver side bitrate estimation. Note that milhouse
        will function fine without it, as will scenic.
    *   Since 0.4, Scenic needs python-simplejson and gnome-themes-extras.
        Install them with aptitude. 

    Backward compatibility:
        Each release in the 0.4 series should be interoperable with each other.

    Milhouse dependency for Scenic
        Scenic always needs the same version of milhouse, eg. scenic 0.4.5
        needs milhouse 0.4.5

    Limitations:
    *   While milhouse supports many video and audio input types, Scenic only 
        supports a subset of them. 
    *   Each release version in the 0.5 branch is considered unstable and will 
        not be supported in the future. Each version is not interoperable with 
        any other version of the unstable 0.5 branch. Wait for the next release 
        in the 0.6 branch to benefit from long term support of the new features 
        of the 0.5 branch.
