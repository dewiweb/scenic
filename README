Scenic: Telepresence software for live performances and installations

Scenic is a free software suite for streaming audio, video and MIDI between live events. It was created at the Society for Arts and Technology (SAT) to give to artists a powerful tool for telepresence in contexts of live arts and new media installations.

The streaming is done over RTP with the GStreamer multimedia framework. Users can also choose low-bandwidth or high-quality codecs, depending on what is available on their system. It offers up to as many audio channels that your audio device supports. Scenic consists in a desktop application and several command-line utilities:

  * scenic: Desktop application to stream audio, video and MIDI over RTP
  * milhouse: Streams audio and video over RTP
  * midistream: Streams MIDI notes and controls over RTP
  * dc-ctl: Controls connected DC IEEE 1394 cameras
  * firereset: Resets a IEEE 1394 bus to help in case of problems
  * jack-info: Prints informations about running JACK servers

Instructions
------------

    Upgrading:
    *   Be sure to uninstall your previous scenic before installing
        scenic.
    *   In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to
        uninstall previous installations.
    *   Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.

    Backward compatibility:
        Each release in the 0.7 series may not be interoperable with each other.

    Milhouse dependency for Scenic
        Scenic always needs the same version of milhouse, eg. scenic 0.4.5
        needs milhouse 0.4.5

    Limitations:
    *   While milhouse supports many video and audio input types, scenic only
        supports a subset of them.
    *   Each release version in the 0.7 branch is considered unstable and will
        not be supported in the future. Each version is not interoperable with
        any other version of the unstable 0.7 branch. Wait for the next release
        in the 0.8 branch to benefit from long term support of the new features
        of the 0.7 branch.
