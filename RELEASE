Release notes for Scenic 0.3.7

Milhouse:
This release fixes a big regression in caps transmission which broke Vorbis and Theora support in 0.3.6.
New features include better v4l2 controls, the ability to restart a sender without restarting a receiver, rtpjitterbuffer
control embedded in our output window, as well as a lot of cleanup and output fixes.

Scenic:
Moved the graphical user interface to GTK+ for faster development.
The Scenic software now polls devices using the Milhouse streamer. 
We implemented SIC, the SIP Spelled Incorrectly protocol, which mimics SIP 
to negotiate the streaming session using JSON over TCP/IP.
Moved Miville code out of trunk. 
Superseded Miville features within a three week code sprint in GTK+!
