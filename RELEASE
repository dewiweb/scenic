Release notes for Scenic 0.4.2

    Milhouse:
    This minor release fixes some system-level bugs. Improvements to
    RTCP stats allow for more detailed info on rtp session quality.
    Cleaner output so that Scenic can report on errors/etc. Improvements
    to --list-cameras.

    Scenic GUI:
    Lots of improvements to the UI, include more advanced state management for both
    sessions and processes. More forwarding of info output by Milhouse (errors, rtcp, etc.)

    Documentation:
    Documentaion for installation is still accurate, but some operations (video
    and audio testing) needs to use more Scenic new features. Documentation has
    been updated to include Debian-specific instructions.  Testing on Debian
    still have to be made, especially that it doesn't come with a realtime kernel.
    Hardware support is probably different too. We'll update

    Upgrading:
    * Be sure to uninstall your previous miville or scenic before installing scenic.
    * In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to uninstall previous
    installations.
    * Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.
    * As of this release, you may want to run ./utils/install_gstreamer.sh 
      again or simply apply the utils/rtpsource.diff patch to gst-plugins-good-0.10.17, 
      then recompile and reinstall it. 
      Refer to https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611213
      This fix adds receiver side bitrate estimation. Note that milhouse will function 
      fine without it, as will scenic.
    * Since 0.4, Scenic needs python-simplejson and gnome-themes-extras. Install them 
    with aptitude.

    Backward compatibility:
    Each release in the 0.4 series should be interoperable between each other.
