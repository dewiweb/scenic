Release notes for Scenic 0.7.1

This release is the first of the unstable 0.7 branch. This branch introduces
support for RTSP, using the --rtsp-server and --rtsp-client options. It also
removes deprecated features and offers more reasonable defaults of milhouse.

Since this is an unstable branch, there is no guarantee that versions will
be interoperable (although we will try to make it so).

See the NEWS and ChangeLog files for a complete history of changes.
See README for instructions.
