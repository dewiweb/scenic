Release notes for Scenic 0.4.3

    Milhouse:
    This release fixes a bug with dc1394src in localvideo. This release
    introduces audiobitrate and quality settings for vorbis and mp3.
    Another new feature is the xid option that allows a user to specify
    an xid for the video window that could belong to a separate process. 

    Scenic GUI:
    This release improves error dialogs and error handling in general.
    It also allows a milhouse video preview to be embedded in scenic.

    Upgrading:
    * Be sure to uninstall your previous miville or scenic before installing
    scenic.
    * In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to
    uninstall previous installations.
    * Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.
    * As of 0.4.2 and later (this release included), 
    you may want to run ./utils/install_gstreamer.sh again or simply
    apply the utils/rtpsource.diff patch to gst-plugins-good-0.10.17,
    then recompile and reinstall it. Refer to
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611213
    This fix adds receiver side bitrate estimation. Note that milhouse
    will function fine without it, as will scenic.
    * Since 0.4, Scenic needs python-simplejson and gnome-themes-extras.
    Install them with aptitude.

    Backward compatibility:
    Each release in the 0.4 series should be interoperable between each other.

    Milhouse dependency for Scenic
    Scenic always needs the same version of milhouse, eg. scenic 0.4.1
    needs milhouse 0.4.1

    Limitations:
    * While milhouse supports many video and audio input types, Scenic
    only support a subset of it. 
    * Network testing and MIDI transmission are not handled by Scenic
    yet.
