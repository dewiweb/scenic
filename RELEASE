Release notes for Scenic 0.4.1

    Milhouse:
    This minor release fixes a bug with the deinterlace option. It has
    also been enabled again in the Scenic graphical user interface. We
    also fixed a bug that was preventing users to see a preview of a local
    video Web camera. An other bug has also been fixed which made the
    listing of cameras impossible on Ubuntu Karmic when the libdc1394
    library was not found. Removed globals.mak

    Scenic GUI:
    This minor release fixes a bug with the Scenic icon which was not
    showing up in the Gnome menu. It is now under
    Applications/Internet/Scenic.

    * Fixed #263 Fixed potential crash in case of wrong JSON library version.
    * Fixed #264 videoflip is frail with input material
    * Moved colorspace converter into videoflip
    * Moved application data out of the Python package.
    * Flattened gst file hierarchy
    * Videoflip (and consequently deinterlace) fixed, added extra colorspace element
    * Installation: shared librairies (except for shared_video) are installed in
    $(prefix)/lib/scenic instead of just $(prefix)/scenic
    * Fixed formatting of some i18n strings.

    Upgrading:
    * Be sure to uninstall your previous miville or scenic before installing scenic.
    * In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to uninstall previous
    installations.
    * Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.
    * ./utils/install_gstreamer.sh haven't been updated since 0.3.1 so there's no need
    to rerun it if you did it for more recent versions

    Backward compatibility:
    Each release in the 0.4 series should be interoperable between each other.

    Milhouse dependency for Scenic
    Scenic always needs the same version of milhouse, eg. scenic 0.4.1 needs milhouse 0.4.1

Release notes for Scenic 0.4

Milhouse:
This release fixes a big regression in caps transmission which broke Vorbis and
Theora support in 0.3.6.
New features include better v4l2 controls, the ability to restart a sender
without restarting a receiver, rtpjitterbuffer control embedded in our output
window, as well as a lot of cleanup and output fixes.

Scenic:
Moved the graphical user interface to GTK+ for faster development.
The Scenic software now polls devices using the Milhouse streamer. 
We implemented SIC, the SIP Spelled Incorrectly protocol, which mimics SIP 
to negotiate the streaming session using JSON over TCP/IP.
Moved Miville code out of trunk. 
Superseded Miville features within a three week code sprint in GTK+!
