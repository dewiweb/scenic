Release notes for Scenic 0.4.5

This release backports a few bugfixes, (mostly in the GUI) and introduces 
no new features since 0.4.3, as new development takes place in the 0.5 branch.

    Upgrading:
    * Be sure to uninstall your previous miville or scenic before installing
    scenic.
    * In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to
    uninstall previous installations.
    * Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.
    * As of 0.4.2 and later, you may want to run ./utils/install_gstreamer.sh
    again or simply apply the utils/rtpsource.diff patch to
    gst-plugins-good-0.10.17, then recompile and reinstall it. Refer to
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611213
    This fix adds receiver side bitrate estimation. Note that milhouse
    will function fine without it, as will scenic.
    * Since 0.4, Scenic needs python-simplejson and gnome-themes-extras.
    Install them with aptitude. 

    Backward compatibility:
    Each release in the 0.4 series should be interoperable with each other.

    Milhouse dependency for Scenic
    Scenic always needs the same version of milhouse, eg. scenic 0.4.5
    needs milhouse 0.4.5

    Limitations:
    * While milhouse supports many video and audio input types, Scenic
    only support a subset of it. 
    * Network testing and MIDI transmission are not handled by Scenic
    as of branch 0.4.

Misc. Fixes:
 * Using HTTP, not FTP for downloading the x264 Gstreamer plugins
 * Added bash completion for the milhouse command line tool

Scenic Fixes:
#379 : Cannot close the delete contact dialog
