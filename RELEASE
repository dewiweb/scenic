Release notes for Scenic 0.5

This release adds many new experimental features. These features include MIDI transmission and VU meters. 

    Upgrading:
    * Be sure to uninstall your previous miville or scenic before installing
    scenic.
    * In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to
    uninstall previous installations.
    * Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.
    * As of 0.4.2 and later, you may want to run ./utils/install_gstreamer.sh
    again or simply apply the utils/rtpsource.diff patch to
    gst-plugins-good-0.10.17, then recompile and reinstall it. Refer to
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611213
    This fix adds receiver side bitrate estimation. Note that milhouse
    will function fine without it, as will scenic.
    * Since 0.4, Scenic needs python-simplejson and gnome-themes-extras.
    Install them with aptitude. 

    Backward compatibility:
    Each release in the 0.4 series should be interoperable with each other.

    Milhouse dependency for Scenic
    Scenic always needs the same version of milhouse, eg. scenic 0.4.5
    needs milhouse 0.4.5

    Limitations:
    * While milhouse supports many video and audio input types, Scenic
    only supports a subset of them. 
    * Each release version in the 0.5 branch is considered unstable and will not be supported in the future. Each version is not interoperable with any other version of the unstable 0.5 branch. Wait for the next release in the 0.6 branch to benefit from long term support of the new features of the 0.5 branch.
