Release notes for Scenic 0.5.10

This release is an other unstable version in the 0.5 series. This version 
contains bugfixes preparing the 0.6 stable series. 

    Upgrading:
    *   Be sure to uninstall your previous miville or scenic before installing
        scenic.
    *   In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to
        uninstall previous installations.
    *   Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.
    *   As of 0.4.2 and later, you may want to run ./utils/install_gstreamer.sh
        again or simply apply the utils/rtpsource.diff patch to
        gst-plugins-good-0.10.17, then recompile and reinstall it. Refer to
        https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611213
        This fix adds receiver side bitrate estimation. Note that milhouse
        will function fine without it, as will scenic.
    *   Since 0.4, Scenic needs python-simplejson and gnome-themes-extras.
        Install them with aptitude. 

    Backward compatibility:
        Each release in the 0.4 series should be interoperable with each other.

    Milhouse dependency for Scenic
        Scenic always needs the same version of milhouse, eg. scenic 0.4.5
        needs milhouse 0.4.5

    Limitations:
    *   While milhouse supports many video and audio input types, Scenic only 
        supports a subset of them. 
    *   Each release version in the 0.5 branch is considered unstable and will 
        not be supported in the future. Each version is not interoperable with 
        any other version of the unstable 0.5 branch. Wait for the next release 
        in the 0.6 branch to benefit from long term support of the new features 
        of the 0.5 branch.
