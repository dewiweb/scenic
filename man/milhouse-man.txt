[SYNOPSIS]
milhouse [--sender|--receiver] --address address [options]

By default, milhouse uses videotestsrc as a video test source and jackaudiosrc for audio input.

[DESCRIPTION]
Streams audio and video using GStreamer over RTP. Can be run either as a sender or a receiver. Can also be used to change V4L2 video device settings, or to display a local preview of what is captured locally.

Milhouse also supports DV cameras and DC cameras, which use IEEE 1394 (Firewire) to capture their video.

For audio, Milhouse provides volume unit meters, so that operators can monitor audio levels.

Milhouse uses the libshmdata library for streaming video to applications. When milhouse is running as a sender, local preview of the video sent is accessible with the libshmdata socket name "/tmp/scenic_local_preview_<host>_<port>", where <host> is the remote host and <port> the port number Milhouse is sending to.

[EXAMPLES]
Here is how to start a receiver and a sender to stream audio and video.

On local_ip_address:

milhouse --receiver --address remote_ip_address --videosink xvimagesink --videocodec mpeg4 --videoport 10030 --audiosink jackaudiosink --audiocodec raw --audioport 10000

On remote_ip_address:

milhouse --sender --address local_ip_address --videocodec mpeg4 --videoport 10030  --videosource v4l2src --audiosource jackaudiosrc --audiocodec raw  -c 2 --audioport 10000

The milhouse command can also be used to change some properties of a V4L2 video device, such as the size and the video standard. The milhouse command should exit immediately once done.

To change the video standard to either NTSC or PAL:

milhouse --v4l2-standard NTSC

To list cameras:

milhouse --list-cameras

To choose an input for a V4L2 device:

milhouse --v4l2-input 1

To obtain a visual representation of the currently running GStreamer pipeline, set the environment variable GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR to a valid directory, i.e. /var/tmp.
