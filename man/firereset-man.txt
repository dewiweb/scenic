[DESCRIPTION]
Sometimes a device that is connected to a computer using a ieee1394 port, also know as Firewire, can become unresponsive. The applications would wait for input or crash. Nothing seems to help, until ones disconnects the device from the ieee1394 port. An other thing that might help is to reset the ieee1394 bus. The firereset command line utility resets the ieee1393 bus.

The default device node is /dev/raw1394, but one can override the default by setting environment variable RAW1394DEV. However, if RAW1394DEV points to a non-existant or invalid device node, then it also attempts to open the default device node. 

Firereset uses the libraw1394 library on GNU/Linux.

[SYNOPSIS]
firereset [options]
.TP

[EXAMPLES]
Simply ussue the command, maybe specifying the environment variable.
