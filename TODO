General: simplify and refactor stuff in gst/ so that it can be reused in rtsp/
(where possible/reasonable). Try to reproduce as much functionality as possible
in rtsp/ as in gst/.

RTSPServer
----
v4l2: use correct aspect ratio.
add support for dv.
support multicast.
add vumeters.

RTSPClient
----
investigate "source" property of uridecodebin
see how we can specify explicitly which ports to use.
use fancier overlay like in GtkVideoSink.
add vumeters.
