General: simplify and refactor stuff in gst/ so that it can be reused in rtsp/
(where reasonable). Try to reproduce functionality from gst/ in rtsp/.

Short term objectives
---------------------
 * merge tmatth/0.7 into team/master...done.
 * document why HDV may not be useful for scenic...done.
 * document cumulated latency...done.
 * shmsink prototype...done (https://github.com/tmatth/gst-prototypes/tree/master/shm)
 * DV tests...not possible (no functioning dv camera).
 * port pkg-config and libtool packaging improvments from 0.6 to 0.7

Future of shared video component
------------------------
 * Replace shared_video.so by the GStreamer elements shmsrc and shmsink, these
 offer more flexibility and robustness compared to our ad-hoc boost::shared mem
 approach.
 * This means SPIN will need to (optionally) depend on GStreamer to use shared video.

RTSPServer
----------
 * v4l2: use correct aspect ratio.
 * add support for dv.
 * support multicast.
 * add vumeters.
