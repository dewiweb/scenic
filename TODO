General: simplify and refactor stuff in gst/ so that it can be reused in rtsp/
(where reasonable). Try to reproduce functionality from gst/ in rtsp/.

Short term objectives
---------------------
 * merge tmatth/0.7 into team/master
 * document why a HDV proto is not possible
 * document cumulated latency
 * shmsink prototype
 * DV tests
 * port pkg-config and libtool packaging improvments from 0.6 to 0.7

Future shared video tool
------------------------
 * Replace shared_video.so by the GStreamer elements shmsrc and shmsink

RTSPServer
----------
 * v4l2: use correct aspect ratio.
 * add support for dv.
 * support multicast.
 * add vumeters.
