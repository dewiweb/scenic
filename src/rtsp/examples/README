run the server with:
./gst-rtsp-cam rtsp://localhost:8554/test
run client:
./test-client

Alternately, you can test the milhouse rtsp server with
./server.sh
and milhouse client:
./client.sh

You should be able to run other clients, such as vlc, totem and mplayer, with
vlc rtsp:://localhost:8554/milhouse --rtsp-caching 15
totem rtsp:://localhost:8554/milhouse
mplayer rtsp:://localhost:8554/milhouse
