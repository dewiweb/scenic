NTA:
-since caps change is asynchronous, caps send/receive must be as well. this is broken currently, i.e. using vorbis and theora together breaks.
-make sure that if we quit with interrupt, everything especially shared memory is cleaned up
-add flag to explicitly send/receive caps on command line

HELLO_WORLD:
-pass map msg around more so we don't get giant parameter lists as per videofactory/audiofactory
-use more message passing, try mike's approach of path=ClassName, args[0]=handler_method, args[1-n]...
-find out if h264 caps can be as simple as gst-plugins good examples would
have us believe
-get sendCaps stuff out of gst/control (aka telnet)
-use milhouse command line to generate caps
-Get rid of singletons, rather have an application space all the necessary objects can listen.
-make sure no exceptions can be thrown from destructors
