-cleanup rtpbin stats reporting, use mapmsg to get stats to hugo, make a map of sessions that gets defined as rtp sessions are
created (and don't forget to trash them when you're done)
-figure out why bitrate varies so much, could be due to ffenc_mpeg4's setting that seems to let it fluctuate by 8mbits!!! use iptraf
-fix glvideosink's black at startup/until fullscreen bug
-teeing video and audio, start with tests
