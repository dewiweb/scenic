NTA:
-test with prerelease tarball of gstffmpeg=0.10.8.2 http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-ffmpeg/pre/gst-ffmpeg-0.10.8.2.tar.gz
-add flag to explicitly send/receive caps on command line
-make sure that if we quit with interrupt, everything especially shared memory is cleaned up

HELLO_WORLD:
-find out if h264 caps can be as simple as gst-plugins good examples would
have us believe
-get sendCaps stuff out of gst/control (aka telnet)
-use milhouse command line to generate caps
-Get rid of singletons, rather have an application space all the necessary objects can listen.
-make sure no exceptions can be thrown from destructors
