-implement dumb algo: rtpreceiver should increase latency if video is present
-adjust audio buffer time based on codec and numchannels and TEST THOROUGHLY
-figure out why bitrate varies so much, could be due to ffenc_mpeg4's setting that seems to let it fluctuate by 8mbits!!! use iptraf
-fix glvideosink's black at startup/until fullscreen bug
-teeing video and audio, start with tests
