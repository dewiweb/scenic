NTA:
-see if v4l2 driver differences between hardy and > make a difference in timestamping issues
-use osc style path for tcp messages
-make sure that if we quit, everything especially shared memory is cleaned up
-use boost signals.slots instead of current msg passing/handling 
-if we have a sender and receiver going, the receiver should for now gracefully ignore subsequent senders after the first sender goes out

HELLO_WORLD:
-rhythmbox uses autoaudiosink, should we? or just look at its approach
-use more message passing, try mike's approach of path=ClassName, args[0]=handler_method, args[1-n]...
-use milhouse command line to generate caps
-Get rid of singletons, rather have an application space all the necessary objects can listen.
-make sure no exceptions can be thrown from destructors
