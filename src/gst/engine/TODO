NTA:
-make sure that if we quit, everything especially shared memory is cleaned up
-use boost signals.slots instead of current msg passing/handling 
-no audioconvert if jack and vorbis are being used
-use smart ptrs more
-if we have a sender and receiver going, the receiver should for now gracefully ignore subsequent senders after the first sender goes out

HELLO_WORLD:
-pass map msg around more so we don't get giant parameter lists as per videofactory/audiofactory
-use more message passing, try mike's approach of path=ClassName, args[0]=handler_method, args[1-n]...
-use milhouse command line to generate caps
-Get rid of singletons, rather have an application space all the necessary objects can listen.
-make sure no exceptions can be thrown from destructors
