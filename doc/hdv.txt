HDV
---

Reliably encoding video from an hdv1394src depends on the robustness of the
mpegts demuxers in GStreamer (currently in gst-plugins-bad). I haven't had any
luck with hdv1394src->encoder pipelines on Ubuntu 10.04. I've managed playback
only, with:

gst-launch hdv1394src ! queue ! decodebin name=d ! queue ! xvimagesink \
                                               d. ! queue ! alsasink

capture to a file would be with

gst-launch hdv1394src ! queue ! filesink location=mydump.ts

Note that HDV adds about 2 and a half seconds delay (just at the input), before 
encoding.
