Click Connect:

	- create connection object from connector with address, port
	- set SDP or similar with settings taken:
		 from the stream obj.
		 from the streams obj.
		 from the setting obj.
		 from the contact obj.
	- send the request to connect.
	
	On a positive answer:
		- connect the com_chan client to the recv com_chan server
		- if not SIP send settings (taken from each contact->setting->streams->stream)
		- start sending each stream (stream can use the com_chan at this moment)
