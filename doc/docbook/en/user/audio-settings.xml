<para>This chapter will cover the audio settings in &app;.</para>

<sect1 id="user.sending-audio">
    <title>Sending Audio</title>
    <para>Right now, &app; only supports either capturing the sound from the <application>JACK</application> audio server, or from a test source. In the "Sending" section of the "Audio" tab, choose the desired source in the "Audio Source" combo box.</para>

    <sect2 id="user.synchronize">
        <title>Synchronization with the video stream</title>
        <para>The audio stream can be synchronized with the video stream, or its timing can be independent. Turning off this option typically results in hearing the sound before seeing the video. It can be suitable for musicians who want an audio latency that is as low as possible.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="user.num-of-chan">
        <title>Number of channels</title>
        <para>The maximum of audio channels depends on the chosen audio codec and audio hardware. It is 2 for MP3, 256 for Vorbis and as much as your hardware supports for Raw audio, if you have an up to date version of the GStreamer plugins installed.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="user.audio-codec">
        <title>Audio codec</title>
        <para>If audio is not compressed, it is said to be "raw" audio, and it is the best quality possible, since it is the same information as when it is captured from your audio input device. Moreover, it will have the lowest latency possible since no buffering was added during an encoding stage.</para>
        <para>If you want to decrease the bandwidth that it used by the audio, it must be encoded. Note that this will increase the latency. There are two supported codecs: Vorbis and MP3. Vorbis is a free high-quality audio codec. Mp3 has more limitations, since the number of channels is limited to 2, and is protected by a patent. The Vorbis codec involves more latency than the MP3 codec.</para>

    <title>Information about the <application>JACK</application> audio server</title>
    <sect2 id="user.jack-latency">
        <title>Estimated <application>JACK</application> Latency</title>
        <para>This information is given to you to help estimate latency. To decrease this latency, you must configure the <application>JACK</application> audio server with better settings. That means to decrease the number of frames per period and the number of periods per buffer. Note that you need a good audio card to safely benefit from a low latency with <application>JACK</application>.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="user.jack-auto-connect">
        <title>Auto connecting <application>JACK</application> ports</title>
        <para>Leave this option enabled if you want to &app; to automatically connect to your sound card's output. Otherwise, it is left to the user to connect the <application>JACK</application> ports of <application>milhouse</application> to and from the audio device's ports. If you want to do some custom routing of the audio channels, we recommend using <application>jack.plumbing</application> to do so.</para>

<sect1 id="user.audio-options">
    <title>Advanced audio options</title>
    <para>The input and output audio buffer size is the size of the buffer between the Gstreamer element and the <application>JACK</application> audio server. Decrease this setting
    to reduce latency. This setting should be modified with care and carefully tested. If the buffer-time is too low, it could result in poor quality audio or instability in &app;.</para>
