    <title>Configuring the MIDI jitter buffer</title>
    <para>The MIDI jitter buffer is a buffer that protects you from the variation in latency. This will prevent the notes from being heard in an irregular flow, creating beats that do not match what the remote musican had played. Increase this number (in milliseconds) in case of high network jitter.</para>
