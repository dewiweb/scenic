  <title>Video Settings</title>
  <para>This chapter describes how to setup your video settings in
  Scenic. How course, Scenic can transmit video to a remote
  peer.</para>
  <para>Each peer configures its video capture size and chooses the
  right device. Next, when using analog capture device, the video
  standard can be PAL or NTSC.</para>
  <para>Scenic is designed so that configuring the video codec must
  be done by the receiver. This way, the receiver can fine tune the
  quality of the image it receives. On the receiver's side, the
  operator can also choose to display the window in full screen on
  a specific display. This is also where the user chooses the
  jitter buffer for the video stream. Increase it to prevent poor
  image quality in case of packets loss. Increasing the jitter
  buffer add mores latency, so it is better to have a sane network
  with close to no packets loss, instead of increasing this
  value.</para>

    image that will be sent to your remote peer.</para>

      <anchor id="Preview" />Preview</title>
      <para>The preview option will show you the video you are
      actually capturing, (The one you will send to the receiver)
      This enable you to validate that you are actually capturing a
      video feed.</para>

      <anchor id="VideoSource" />Video Source</title>
      <para>Here you can choose witch video source you want to use
      to send. To make a color test, you can use the Color bars.
      Scenic detects which supported video devices are connected to
      your computer, and lists them there. It tries to detect them
      every tiem the user switches to the video tab, and when
      trying to initiate a streaming session with a peer. That
      means that if you don't see a video device you have just
      plugged, you could try switching to an other tab, and
      switching back to the video tab, to see if it is
      detected.</para>

      <anchor id="VideoInput" />Video Input</title>
      <para>Some devices have many input, such as S-Video,
      composite, etc. In this case, you must choose the input to
      which the camera is connected to.</para>
      <para>If using an analog video capture card, S-Video is
      generally preferable over a composite input, since it offers
      a better image quality, especially for colors. A component
      input is even better. S-Video is an analog video signal that
      carries video data as two separate signals: luma (luminance)
      and chroma (color). This differs from composite video, which
      carries picture information as a single lower-quality signal,
      and component video, which carries picture information as
      three separate higher-quality signals.</para>

      <anchor id="VideoStandard" />Video Standard</title>
      <para>When using an analog video capture card, this
      configuration entry must be set accordingly to the video
      standard of the camera. Most of the Americas, Japan, South
      Korea, Taiwan, Burma, and some Pacific island nations and
      territories use NTSC. The rest of the world use PAL</para>
      <para>PAL: Phase Alternate Line, is an analogue television
      encoding system used in broadcast television systems in large
      parts of the world. Many European country uses this standard.
      NTSC: National Television System Committee, is the analog
      television system used in most of North America, South
      America, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Burma, and some Pacific
      island nations and territories.</para>

      <anchor id="AspectRatio" />Aspect Ratio</title>
      <para>The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio of the width
      of the image to its height. Scenic currently supports 4:3 and
      16:9. Finally, the aspect ratio can be 4:3 or 16:9, depending
      on if the image source provides square pixels or rectangle
      pixels. Commonly used values are 16:9 for 704x480 and 4:3 for
      640x480</para>

      <para>Choose h.263 for low bandwidth or low CPU setup. Use
      Theora for a patent-free experience. Use MPEG4 for most
      situation. Use h.264 to use all the CPU power you

      <anchor id="VideoBitrate" />Video Bitrate</title>
      <para>Video bitrate is the number of bits of video data that
      are conveyed or processed per unit of time. It is expressed
      in Mega bits per second. Video bitrate capabilities varies
      depending of the video codec used:</para>
      <para>video: high-bandwidth (H.264), medium-bw (MPEG-4),
      low-bw (H.263)</para>
