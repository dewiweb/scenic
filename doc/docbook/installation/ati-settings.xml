      <para>If you're using the fglrx driver, you may have to
      enable the XVideo extension with the aticonfig command (part
      of the xorg-driver-fglrx package).</para>
        <para><userinput>sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv</userinput></para>
        <para>Alternatively, you can manually add those lines in
        the Device section of the fglrx driver in the
        /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. After Driver "fglrx" , add:</para>
        <para>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Option &#160; &#160;
        &#160;"VideoOverlay" "on"</para>
        <para>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Option &#160; &#160;
        &#160;"OpenGLOverlay" "off"</para>
        <para>Note: As now, it's unclear which ATI cards properly
        supports Xvideo. Feel free to share your
        experiences.</para>
