Milhouse:
    * For Ubuntu 9.04 and later, one must use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost for local connections
    * Audio test source might use 100% of your CPU power!
    * scenic uses 100% of CPU due to pygtk bug on Ubuntu 10.10
        * The bug is described fully here:
            http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4658
        * The fix has already been applied upstream:
            https://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=179466&action=edit
        * A workaround until Ubuntu decides to fix this would be to install the
          patched version of pygtk:
