Milhouse:
    * Audio test source might use 100% of your CPU power!
    * rtpL16depay does not work properly prior to gst-plugins-good-0.10.25
      * Because of this upstream bug
        https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=623209
        raw audio will not work correctly using rtsp since the rtpL16depayloader
        will not be able to determine how many channels it should have. A
        workaround where the channels are explicitly set MIGHT be possible.
        This bug is present in Ubuntu 10.04 (fixed in 10.10).

Scenic:
    * scenic uses 100% of CPU due to pygtk bug on Ubuntu 10.10
        * The bug is described fully here:
          http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4658
          The fix has already been applied upstream:
          https://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=179466&action=edit
          A workaround until Ubuntu decides to fix this would be to install the
          patched version of pygtk:
