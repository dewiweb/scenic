[DESCRIPTION]
The Miville Audio/Video Streaming Software for GNU/Linux

[SYNOPSIS]
mivilled [options]

[EXAMPLES]
Miville is intended to be run as a daemon started by the user in a X11 session. 
You can start it in a shell in the background as an automatically started script
when you log in. 

  mivilled -v &

You can choose the network interface under which miville will listen 
for the HTTP of telnet user interfaces. They are specified with the -I flag.

  mivilled -I 10.10.10.55

You can specify a port offset for all UI ports. 

  mivilled -o 1

You can make miville listen to all network interfaces on your computer. 
This is insecure but easier to use. 

  mivilled -a
