We use trial to run the tests.

trial test/test_common.py

They are also specified in the makefile.am :

make check

Test names prefixes :

    * "test_"  : unit tests. Those tests must be in Makefile.am to be
                 automatically tested with "make check"
    * "once_"  : work in progress. Not part of official test suites.
                 For developement purposes.
    * "check_" : tests that internally start miville and telnet processes to
                 test. Most of them use test/lib_miville_telnet.py.
    * "dist_"  : Official test case testing. Those tests need two computers.
                 Miville needs to be started manually on both prior to run them.
    * "lib_"   : Libraries for making tests
