We use trial to run the tests.

trial test/test_common.py

They are also specified in the makefile.am :

make check 

Test names prefixes :

    * "test_"  : unit tests.
    * "once_"  : work in progress. Not part of official test suites.
    * "check_" : tests that internally start miville and telnet processes to 
                 test. They use py/utils/telnet_testing.py
    * "dist_"  : Official test case testing. Those tests need two computers. 
                 Miville needs to be started manually on both prior to run them. 
    * "lib_"   : Libraries for making tests
