Presets and settings generators
--------------------------------
Presets created with python scripts. 
Those Python scripts are located in py/test/.
They are tests that generate different sets of settings for Miville. 
To generate the presets, run it this way::

  cd py/
  trial test/..... <<<< I don't know

Here is the list of files in that directory. We should add a comment for each of these files.::

  addressbook.txt
  dist_bidi_AV_settings.txt
  dist_bidi_video.settings.txt
  dist_two_way_audio.settings.txt
  settings_may_01.txt
